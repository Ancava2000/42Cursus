## About üöÄ
This project consists of reprogramming the ```printf()``` function from the libc library. Your function will be compared with the original printf. It should be noted that it is not necessary to implement the buffer management of the original printf and that it will handle various conversion formats. The prototype of ft_printf() is:
```c
int ft_printf(char const *, ...);
```
```You are going to discover a very famous and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is a moderately difficult exercise. You will also discover variadic functions in C. The key to succeeding in ft_printf is having well-structured and extensible code.```
<a id="Var"></a>
## Variadic Functions üßæ
The main complexity of this function lies in: **dealing with an indeterminate number and type of parameters** (pointed by the elipsis in the parameters of the prototype) and **returning an ```int``` type.**
The first problem is a function named variadic function, which consists of at least one fixed variable and then an ellipsis(‚Ä¶) as the last parameter. To handle this we use the macros of the stdarg.h library:

| **Function Name**         | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **va_list** <sub>(typedef)<sub>       | Holds the information needed by va_start, va_arg, va_end, and va_copy. Ex: ```va_list ptr``` \\\ Declaring pointer to the argument list \\\     |
| **va_start** <sub>(macro)<sub>        | Enables access to variadic function arguments. Ex: ```va_start(ptr, n)``` \\\ Initializing argument to the list pointer \\\ |
| **va_arg** <sub>(macro)<sub>          | Accesses the next variadic function argument. Ex: ```sum += va_arg(ptr, int)``` \\\ Accessing current variable and pointing to next one \\\ |
| **va_end** <sub>(macro)<sub>          | Ends traversal of the variadic function arguments. Ex: ```va_end(ptr)``` \\\ Ending argument list traversal \\\ |

To solve the integer problem, an ```int count``` variable is initialized in the prototype function. This variable stores the value of the function based on the format used in printf. Finally, count is the variable that is returned. Example:
```c
int	ft_printf(char const *str, ...)
{
	va_list	ap;
	int	count;

	count = 0;
	va_start(ap, str);
	while (*str != '\0')
	{
		if (*str == '%')
		{
			str++;
			count += ft_format(*str, ap);
		}
		else
			count += write(1, str, 1);
		++str;
	}
	va_end(ap);
	return (count);
}
```

## Formats üí´
In your printf you must be able to use the following formats:

| **Format**         | Description                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **%c**  | Prints a character. ```char```  |
| **%s**  | Prints a string. ```char *``` |
| **%p**  | Prints a ```void pointer``` in hexadecimal format |
| **%d**  | Prints a decimal number (10 base) |
| **%i**  | Prints an integer (10 base). ```√¨nt```|
| **%u**  | Prints an ```unsigned integer``` (10 base) |
| **%x**  | Prints an hexadecimal numer in lowercase (16 base)|
| **%X**  | Prints an hexadecimal numer in uppercase (16 base) |
| **%%**  | Prints the % symbol |

## Structure üóÉÔ∏è

In the ```ft_printf()``` function the int count to be returned and the va_list macro are initialized. The ```ft_format()``` function is called when it encounters the % symbol and, depending on the next character, one function or another is called. To deal with the problem of returning an int, in the variable count is stored the result of any of these functions.

```ft_format()``` calls a function for each of the formats to be printed:
- [```ft_putchar_pf()```](https://github.com/Ancava2000/42Cursus/blob/main/printf/ft_putchar_pf.c) prints ```char``` variables.
- [```ft_putstr_pf()```](https://github.com/Ancava2000/42Cursus/blob/main/printf/ft_putstr_pf.c) prints a ```char *```variable iterating the ```ft_putchar``` function. The count variable to return is incremented in each loop.  
- [```ft_putdigit_pf()```](https://github.com/Ancava2000/42Cursus/blob/main/printf/ft_putdigit_pf.c) recursively prints a number (unsigned, integer or hexadecimal). To print an hexadecimal, it uses a string called symbols, with all the necessary numbers and letters for the uppercase and lowercase cases.
- [```ft_printptr_pf()```](https://github.com/Ancava2000/42Cursus/blob/main/printf/ft_printptr_pf.c) prints a pointer in hexadecimal format. The ```ft_putstr()``` function is called to print the prefix "0x".

Example of main:
```c
int main (void)
{
	ft_printf("%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x\n", 'a', "hello", 42, 42, -100, 4242, -1);
	printf("%c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x\n", 'a', "hello", 42, 42, -100, 4242, -1);
	return (0);
}
```

<a id="Make"></a>
## Makefile ‚ôªÔ∏è

A *Makefile* is a tool that sets a set of rules, like a script does, that helps us in the proccess of compiling our files into an ```executable``` (only in compiled languages like c). 42 in particular asks for a Makefile that can:
   - Compile into a specific named ```library.```
   - Get its ```source files``` from an indicated directory and with their last modifide dates.
   - Compile the ```.c files``` with ```clang``` and with ```-Wall -Wextra -Werror flags``` in that order.
   - Implement the rules ```clean``` (remove all the temporary generated files), ```fclean``` (make clean plus `clean the executable), ``re`` (make fclean followed by make all), ``all`` (what the central or default task of a Makefile is customarily called) and ``Phony`` (you can explicitly declare targets, like clean or all, to be phony by making it a prerequisite. This is to avoid compiling errors in the case that a file in the same directory is named the same as a target).
   - Avoid ```relink``` (when we type multiple timess the command make there won't be a new recompilation).

<a id="Comm"></a>
### Commands

To compile the files into an executable:
```
make
```
To compile with the main and make tests (to compile into an executable, it's very important that you write before the main.c than the library):
```
clang main.c yourlibraryname.a (-o name)
```
To remove all the temporary generated files (.o):
```
make clean
```
To remove everything plus the executable:
```
make fclean
```
